so it's my second article written in english~greate!!!

i recently take an online course on udacity,use python to write a search engine~

not just awesome,but it tell me that how such monster like google being built.and i love pytho!

it showes that code course could be tought in this way,and the online edu interaction could play
like this...

so ,here is the link~~and i wonder how many guys would do the final homework.would find a time to place the little search code on GAE,and make a gui for it~~~

if you come from china,why not go to the v2ex to share your learing experince with geeks....

find the course on [udacity][], keep learing .
